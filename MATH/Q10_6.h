 * @brief Fixed Point Numbers 16bits binary fixed point numbers 10bits integer 6bits fractional
 * @details The Q notation consists of the letter Q followed by a pair of numbers m.n
 * where m is the number of bits used for the integer part of the value, and n is the number of fraction bits.
 * By default, the notation describes signed binary fixed point format, with the unscaled integer being stored
 * in two's complement format, used in most binary processors.
 * The first bit always gives the sign of the value(1 = negative, 0 = non-negative), and it is not counted in
 * the m parameter. Thus, the total number w of bits used is 1 + m + n.
