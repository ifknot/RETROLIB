* @brief  INT 1A,0 - Read System Clock Counter - it is incremented about once every 55 ms by INT 08H.
* @details Reads the BIOS Data Area address 40:6C Timer Counter DWord as updated by the INT 08 routine.
* INT 08 Timer (IRQ 0)  This interrupt is issued 18.2 times per second and is responsible for updating the
* system timer at 40:6C BDA, resetting diskette drive motors, and issuing INT 1C.
*
* @note The reality is that vector 08h wasn't "unused".
* In fact it was listed as reserved all the way back to Intel's design specification documents.
* Intel on the 8086/8088 reserved the first 32 interrurpt vectors.
* The problem is that IBM ignored Intel and actually used reserved vectors for the 8259.
* This caused the problems when the 80286 and 80386 came out (Coprocessor vector clashed and the 8259A clashed).
* Had IBM not designed a flawed system from the start and conformed to Intel this clash wouldn't have happened â€“ as per the iAPX 86 and 88 Intel manual from 1981, page 4-17
* "...the first five interrupt vectors are associated with the software-initiated interrupts and the hardware non-maskable interrupt (NMI).
* The next 27 interrupt vectors are reserved by Intel and should not be used if compatibility with future Intel products is to be maintained..."
*
* AH = 00
* on return:
* AL = midnight flag, 1 if 24 hours passed since reset
* CX = high order word of tick count
* DX = low order word of tick count
* incremented approximately 18.206 times per second
* at midnight CX:DX is zero
